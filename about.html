                    <p style="text-align: left;" class="sm-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outcome of Betrayal is a metal band
                        based in Saint Louis, Missouri. The band had its beginnings in 2008. Guitarist Brian Crangle and
                        vocalist James Simpson, friends from prior music ventures, decided to start their own group. The
                        next year, in 2009, Patrick Sommer was added to the band as the drummer and things really started
                        to come together. After months of searching Jarrod Meine was added as the second guitarist, followed
                        by Mark Drago as the bands bass player. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By June of 2010, the band
                        had composed music and perfected a full set list. It was at this same time that they recorded a demo
                        CD of 4 songs. Not long after the demo was released the band decided to move forward without Jarrod
                        Meine. Almost immediately Alex Hughes stepped in and brought a new addition to the group. The band
                        continued to write new music and continued playing shows in the St Louis area. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
                        quickly gained momentum and fans in the local St Louis music scene as well as online. This included
                        winning a spot at "Pointfest" (a music festival put on by 105.7 The Point, a local radio station)
                        in the summer of 2012 by winning a multi level competition called "Battle for Pointfest". This allowed
                        the band to play in front of it's largest crowd ever, gaining a lot of exposure.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
                        the late Summer of 2012, Bass Player Mark Drago and founding guitarist Brian Crangle decided to part
                        ways from the band due to personal reasons. The remaining members decided to go on hiatus for the
                        remainder of the yearto continue writing while finding replacements. A friend of the band Alex Schuler
                        decided to step up and try out to fill the guitar slot. He quickly added a new formula to the bands
                        writing structure and became the new guitarist in the late summer of 2012. In the fall of 2012 the
                        band took on friend Danny Wesche as their new bass player after he came in and picked up the spot
                        like it was his own. Alex and Danny have brought a new light and spirit to the band, and have made
                        Outcome of Betrayal stronger than ever. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 31st 2012, the
                        band released its official 4 song EP called "It's Time to Change" nationwide on major online media
                        outlets and stores like I-tunes & Amazon. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outcome of Betrayal has
                        been influenced by a number of well-known metal bands. They include Soilwork, Killswitch Engage,
                        As I Lay Dying, Haste the Day, and In Flames. The band took inspiration from these groups and learned
                        from each of their skills and styles. In the end, the band has created a unique style with fast and
                        heavy instrumentals and a wide range of vocal techniques and sounds.
